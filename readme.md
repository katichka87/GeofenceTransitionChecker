The app detects if the user is inside or outside some geofence area.
The geofence is input from screen controls: latitude, longtitude, radius and WiFi network SSID.
It is also possible to pick latitude and longtitude on map.
After the geofence is set - it is registered in Google Geofencing service. So when the device enters or exits the defined geofence - the app receives notification form the service.
If the device is not reported inside the geofence but the device is connected to the given WiFi network - it is displayed on the screen that the user is inside the geofence.
